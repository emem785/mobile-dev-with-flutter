# Assignment

1. Write a function that takes in a type `List` as an input and prints out all the items in that list

```dart

main() {

// You will be using this list for this excercise
  List days = [
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
    "Sunday"
  ];

// Call your function here.
}

//write your function here.

```
2. Write a function with an argument & return type of `List`, which takes every element of the initial list and creates a new list with each of those elements multiplied by 2, and then returns the newly created list.

```dart
main() {
// You will be using this list for this excercise
List numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

//call function here and get transformed list

//print out new list
}

//write your function here

```

**For example**

*A list that looks like this initially*

`[2,4,5,12,9,6,7]`

*will turn into this*

`[4,8,10,24,18,12,14]`

*remember to use the* `toList` *function*
